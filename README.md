# HD‑Zero Documentation & Firmware Archive 📦

Welcome to the **HD‑Zero Documentation & Firmware Archive** — a community-maintained backup of all official **PDF manuals**, **firmware ZIPs**, **utilities**, and **reference materials** from [HD‑Zero](https://www.hd-zero.com/).

This project ensures that **every HDZero user can access critical resources**, whether you're upgrading firmware in the field, referencing a wiring diagram at your workbench, or helping a friend set up their first digital FPV system.

> 🛡️ **No pilot left behind.** This archive exists to guarantee access to HDZero firmware and documentation — now and in the future.

## 📌 Why This Exists

- ✅ Preserve firmware, manuals, and tools regardless of website availability
- 🌐 Provide a single, easy-to-navigate source of HDZero content
- 🛠️ Support offline use for field repairs, community events, and workshops
- 🤝 Empower community contributions and long-term resilience

This is a **grassroots, unofficial project** built by and for the FPV community.
